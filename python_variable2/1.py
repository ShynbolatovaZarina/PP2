x = 5

print(x)
print(y)

x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

# is the same as

# Exercise 1
# What is a correct way to declare a Python variable?
# 1) var x = 5
# 2) #x = 5
# 3) $x = 5
# 4) x = 5 (true)


# Exercise 2
# You can declare string variables with single or double quotes.
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
# 1) True  (yes)
# 2) False


# Exercise 3
# Variable names are not case-sensitive.
a = 5
# is the same as
A = 5
# 1) True
# 2) False    (yes)


# Exercise 4
# Select the correct functions to print the data type of a variable:
# print(type(myvar))
